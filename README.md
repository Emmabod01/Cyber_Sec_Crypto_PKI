Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI) Lab

The learning objective of this lab is to gain the first-hand experience on PKI.

I gained better understanding of how PKI works, how PKI is used to protect the Web, and how Man-in-the-middle attacks can be defeated by PKI.

Moreover, I understood the root of the trust in the public-key infrastructure, and what problems will arise if the root trust is broken. 

This lab covers the following topics:
• Public-key encryption
• Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI)
• Certificate Authority (CA) and root CA
• X.509 certificate and self-signed certificate
• Apache, HTTP, and HTTPS
• Man-in-the-middle attacks


Lab environemnt: LINUX/UNIX - #Ubuntu
